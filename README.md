  ## Tests
  
  Once the application is installed and running it can be tested using Insomnia. The test routes can be imported to insomnia from the Insomnia_test_routes.json file in the assets folder. All user, thought and reaction Id's will have to be updated beacause they will be generated when the database is seeded.
